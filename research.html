                    <p><span class="ind">As an undergraduate, I worked as thesis student at the Madidi project in Bolivia.
                                 This is a botanical project in collaboration between the Missouri Botanical Garden and the 
                                 "Herbario Nacional de Bolivia".
                                 The main goals of the project are to describe and document the flora of a tropical forest:
                                 the Madidi region, and to study the structure and dynamics of plant species, while contributing to the conservation 
                                 of tropical forests. The project consist in a network of large and small plots where all the adult trees have been censed and 
                                 measured, which covers a broad elevational range within the Madidi Region of Northwestern Bolivia.<br></p>

                                 During that, I worked on my degree Thesis on the taxonomy of four sections of the genus Inga.
                                 After graduating, I continued working for the project as Technician where I collected data on functional traits and 
                                 participated in a couple of field expeditions to the plots.<br><br></span>

                                There kept working with data from this project for my thesis, where I studied the

                    <p id="lic-description"><strong>Abstract</strong>
                            Proper delimitation and identification of species is vital for the knowledge of the plant
                            diversity in general and specially in megadiverse countries like Bolivia. Despite the
                            development of other taxonomic classification methods, the morphological taxonomy is
                            still very important due to the fact that it is more practical, cheaper and its results are
                            reliable. The morfometric analysis provides in particular, repeatability and objectivity. At
                            present Bolivia does not have an updated treatment of the genus Inga, from the Fabaceae
                            family, for this reason this work pretends to provide a taxonomic revision of the sections
                            Complanatae, Inga and Tetragonae, and their species represented in the country, based on
                            morphological analysis. I chose to work with this genus because of its ecological,
                            economic and social importance. For the morphometric analysis, a principal component
                            analysis was realized, which confirm the separation of the predefined species by
                            Pennington in 1997. In addition a new species of the Complanatae section was described
                            and the presence of I. feuillei in Bolivia was confirmed. Based in the data collected and the
                            result of the PCA, the taxonomic treatment was elaborated for the three sections with their
                            respective species. This work includes de description of the species, their distribution and
                            conservation status in Bolivia, and some information about the recorded phenology.<br><br>

                            During the last few thousand years, human population growth and resource use has 
                            been reshaping the planet’s nutrient cycles, climate and biodiversity and might be 
                            causing significant changes to spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution of 
                            species, and a general erosion of biodiversity at global scales. Many studies have 
                            been looking to model and predict how species could respond to actual rates of 
                            change on environmental conditions, with a high interest in terms of species 
                            distribution and richness with potential extinctions. However, how global change 
                            impact local communities still remains unclear. Moreover, previous research suffers 
                            from a significant bias against Tropical montane regions. In this study, we evaluate 
                            whether diversity and composition of communities in an Andean Tropical forest are 
                            changing, potentially in response to changes in environmental conditions. We analyze 
                            the dynamics in 26 forest plots that are part of a larger network of nearly 490 plots 
                            located on the eastern slopes of the Bolivian Andes. We quantify mortality and 
                            recruitment rates, document changes in diversity and compare changes in species 
                            composition to null model expectations. We have that mortality and recruitment rates 
                            occur at about 1.6% per year, and that richness seems to be increasing in regions of 
                            cold climates, but decreasing in warm regions. Finally, we find evidence that community 
                            composition is shifting across all environmental conditions. Our analyses support the 
                            idea that communities in the Tropical Andes are going through changes consistent with 
                            an effect of global change. However, the final causes for the changes we observe are 
                            yet unknown. Understanding the responses of forest communities is urgently needed 
                            to advance theory in community ecology, but also to understand and manage natural 
                            ecosystems in a changing World.
